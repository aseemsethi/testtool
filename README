This is a Monitor Application v2.0. Testing support for the following are implemented.
- SSL Functionaland Performance
- HTTP Performance
- IKEv2 Functional and Performance

To generate Documentation
-------------------------
doxygen -g  // to generate Doxyfile
vi Doxyfile  // set options - RECURSIVE=YES
doxygen Doxyfile  // run the tool

Clone a new tree
----------------
git clone https://aseemsethi@github.com/aseemsethi/monitor.git

Libraries to be installed:
openssl, openssl-devel, curl, curl-devel, expat
yum install gcc-c++

The Monitor Application is a single binary called "mont_cust". This is spawned as follows :
 For SSL Function Test: ./mont_cust 100 ssl
 For SSL Performance Test: ./mont_cust 100 ssl_perf
 For HTTP Test: ./mont_cust 100 http

There are many Assessment Tools today that can also be used. One such list of tools is at https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/Assessment-Tools.  A list of cve ids is maintained at: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=openssl
Some other tools that are used for HTTP testing are burp, wrk

Executing
=========
There are 2 ways to run the tool
a) Run it from shell "./mont_cust 100 openvpn". This reads the config from /var/,mont/100/config.json.
b) Run it using the Django framework. For, this one needs to configure the various parameters in the Edit screen, and these then go as a parameter to the ./mont_cust program. Instead of reading the config file at /var/mont/100/config.json, it accepts another parameter, which is the configuration file in json format. From that point the code path is the same.

Logging
=======
The SSL Test Process executes all tests, and write:
- log file in /var/monT/<custID> - ssl_logs, ssl_perf_logs, http_logs
- stat  file in /var/monT/<custID> - ssl_stats, ssl_perf_stats, http_stats

Configuration Parsing
=====================
We use the jsmn parser from 
	hg clone http://bitbucket.org/zserge/jsmn jsmn

HTTP Tool
========
For httpRepeat times, the HTTP Tool will do a parallel get using httpParallel threads. Each thread will be loaded with either the given url param, or from the code, if no url is provided.

BGP Tool
========
This tool can be used for negative testing. One can change attributes from version to other fields to test BGP peer.

Config: Set routerID to be the ID of you own BGP machine, i.e. this simulator
"withdrawn Len" - is the len of bytes following this field, and consists of 1 or more pairs of "withdrawn prefix" + "withdrawn route".
Note that the "Withdrawn Len" and "Path Attribute Len" is set to 0 in the config. The code calculates the length of these 2 fields, depending on the configuration provided.
Running: Run the bgp tool by "./mont_cust 100 bgp". The tool first connects using TCP to the peer router, given by the "server IP" in the General Section at top of the config file.
Then it sends an BGP OPEN message to the peer. It then awaits a BGP KEEPALIVE to the peer. It then awaits a BGP UPDATE message from the peer, and on receipt it sends an BGP Update message to the peer.
The Withdrawn Routes and Advertised routes are advertised in this Update message.
If "repeat nlri" is set to non-zero value, then the 1st nlri-len/prefix value is taken and repeated "repeat nlri" times, each time, incrementing the lowest byte of the "nlri preifx" by 1.
If "repeat delay" is set, then after every 800 routes sent in 1 packet, there is a sleep of "repeat delay" seconds, before the next 800 routes are sent.
If "repeat update" is set to a non-zero value, an UPDATE advertising NLRI routes is sent, followed by another UPDATE withdrawing all NLRI routes. This is repeated "nlri update" number of times.

BGP Shell:
When the tool runs, after the built in tests, it drops to a shell. Here you need to give the following commands
bgp    -- this puts the tool in “bgp” mode.  Type “exit” to get out of this mode. You will also notice that the prompt changes from “proto>” to “bgp>”, when in “bgp” mode.
update xxxx   - this sends an update with the contents of the file. As of now, it just repeats the Update packet it sent out last, but I will add the logic for it to read the file xxxx and send its contents by tomorrow.
withdraw xxxx   - this sends an update-withdraw with the contents of the file. As of now, it just repeats the Update-Withdraw packet it sent out last, but I will add the logic for it to read the file xxxx and send its contents by tomorrow.

BGP Test Tool:
Edit /usr/local/etc/bird.conf as follows, and start bird as: bird -d
- source address is the address of eth0 on the bird m/c, and 
- local is AS number of this bird m/c.
protocol bgp {
	local as 1111;
	neighbor 192.168.1.106 as 1;
	multihop;
	source address 192.168.1.110;
	import all;
}

SSL Versions and Recommendations
================================
SSL 2.0 released in 1995 should no longer be used at all. 
SSL 2.0 was declared insecure primarily due to its re-use of encryption
keys as well as its lack of integrity checking of the SSL handshake
sequence.
A server using TLS 1.0 should select cipher RC4 for encryption 
during the cipher negotiation for HTTPS traffic to mitigate against 
the BEAST attack. 

NOTES:
======
If RSA is used for both Key Exchange (Encryption) and Authentication, then if the key is lost tomorrow to a hacker, the hacker could use that key to get all past data. This is becuase we reused the same key for 2 things - auth and encyption. Thus, DHE_RSA was done, wherein Ephemeral keys in DH were used to generate shared secret, and were signed by RSA for authentication. This info is sent in Server Key Exchange message.
